Understanding Objects and their Internal Representation in JavaScript

Introduction:
JavaScript, as an object-oriented programming language, revolves around objects. Objects are a fundamental concept in JavaScript, providing a way to organize and manipulate data. In this blog, we will delve into objects and explore their internal representation in JavaScript, shedding light on their structure and behavior.

What are Objects in JavaScript?
In JavaScript, objects are complex data types that allow us to represent real-world entities, concepts, or abstractions. They consist of properties and methods, which are essentially variables and functions associated with the object. Objects serve as containers that encapsulate related data and functionality, making them an essential part of JavaScript programming.

Internal Representation of Objects:
To understand the internal representation of objects in JavaScript, we need to explore a concept called "prototype-based inheritance." Unlike traditional class-based languages, JavaScript adopts a prototype-based approach, where objects are created by cloning or inheriting from other existing object
